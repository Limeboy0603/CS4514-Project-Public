# Sign Language Recognition and Translation using Motion Tracking and Deep Learning

This project aims to continuously recognize Hong Kong sign language and translate them into a single sentence. It involves 2 different modules.
- A LSTM model for sign language recognition
- A language model for translation from glosses to sentences

To set up the project, follow the instructions in `docs/setup.md`.
